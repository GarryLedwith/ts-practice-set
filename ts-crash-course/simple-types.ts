/*
TypeScript supports some simple types (primitive types) that are commonly used in programming. These include:
- `number`: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.
- `string`: Represents a sequence of characters (text).
- `boolean`: Represents a true or false value.

are the three basic types in TypeScript. They can be used to define variables, function parameters, and return types.
These types are fundamental to TypeScript and are used to ensure type safety in your code. They
help catch errors at compile time rather than runtime, making your code more robust and maintainable.

// Example of simple types in TypeScript
let age: number = 30; // `age` is explicitly typed as a number
let randomName: string = "Alice"; // `name` is explicitly typed as a string
let isActive: boolean = true; // `isActive` is explicitly typed as a boolean
